    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat canola and sesame oils in a large, nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add carrot and 1/4 cup green onion; cook, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes. Stir in garlic powder and ginger and cook for 2 minutes. Stir in rice, salt, and pepper; cook, stirring only once or twice, until rice is lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in chicken and peas; cook for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Push rice mixture to the sides of the pan, creating a circle in the middle. Add butter to the center of the pan. When melted, pour eggs into the center. Cook eggs, stirring often, until almost set, about 3 minutes. Stir eggs into the rice mixture. Stir in soy sauce and rice vinegar; cook for 2 more minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately topped with Sriracha mayo and green onions.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <p>Cook's Notes:</p>
    <p>You can use leftover pork, steak, or shrimp in place of chicken.</p>
    <p>Avoid stirring too much when the rice is added so that it will get lightly crispy and caramelized around the edges... that's the best part!</p>
